# Relationship between Electric Vehicles and Oil: Analyzing TSLA and USO

**Mission**

In this project we research the relationship between Electric Vehicles (TSLA) and Oil (USO) to determine how prices of TSLA are correlated to Oil. We conduct data cleaning, quantitative analysis, graphs with Hvplots, and implement Montecarlo simulations. We use SPY as a benchmark for the market. 

Correlations, Sharpe Ratios, and Betas shown. Correlations for different time periods are also explored.  Montecarlo is employed in order to forecast the future prices of TSLA and USO in order to determine if a trend will continue in EV vs Oil prices. 

**End Result of Analysis**

Conclusion: Through our analysis we found TSLA's correlation with oil to be surprisngly low. The SPY's were twice as correlated as TSLA was to OIL over the time period. We also determine TSLA is a better investment than USO.
