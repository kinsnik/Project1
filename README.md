# Relationship between Electric Vehicles and Oil: Analyzing TSLA and USO

**Mission**

In this project we research the relationship between Electric Vehicles (TSLA) and Oil (USO) to determine how prices of TSLA are correlated to Oil. We conduct data cleaning, quantitative analysis, graphs with Hvplots, and implement Montecarlo simulations. We use SPY as a benchmark for the market. 

Correlations, Sharpe Ratios, and Betas shown. Correlations for different time periods are also explored.  Montecarlo is employed in order to forecast the future prices of TSLA and USO in order to determine if a trend will continue in EV vs Oil prices. 

We hypothesized that there would be a negative correlation between TSLA and USO, for example when TSLA stock prices rise, USO stock prices would fall. 

**Conclusion**

Through our analysis we found TSLA's correlation with USO to be surprisingly low but not negative, which we hypothesized. The market's correlation to oil is twice that of TSLA over the time period. We also determined TSLA is a better current and future investment than USO.
