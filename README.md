# Project1 for Fintech Bootcamp

#Researching the correlation between Electric Vehicles and Oil#

This project utilizes SQLAlchemy, Pandas datareader, and montecarlo.  The goal of the project is to explore the realtionship
between EV manufacturers (using TSLA as the proxy) and Oil (using USO as the proxy).  Correlations, Sharpe ratios, and betas are also 
calculated.  Correlations for different time periods are also explored.  Montecarlo is employed in order to forecast the 
prices of TSLA and USO at the end.
